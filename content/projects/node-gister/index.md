I write articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@aravindballa) generally. And most of them are technical one which sometimes required code samples
for better understanding. So I upload Gists and copy paste that URL on to Medium. It gives a nice formatted code display.

This tool is to help me do this process faster. This lets me upload files via. commandline and gives back the URL which I can include directly.
