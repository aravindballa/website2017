I like building things that make me more productive. Things which support me in the work I do. One of them is Universal Copy.

Using this, we can copy stuff/text from Chrome(Web) and paste it on your mobile(Android). The vice-versa has not been done yet. But thatâ€™s the concept.

We use many devices daily. And sharing content between them is hard. For documents and files, we have things like Google Drive and Dropbox. But if you want a link/url that you want to send or a piece of text like address that you SMS your friend, then we find it hard to send it to mobile.

So I, with help of my friend, [Raghava](https://instagram.com/m_sairaghava), built this to integrate clipboards of the devices that we use in a daily basis.

**Update**

I don't have the code for this anymore. I lost it when I crashed my external HDD. I somehow did not push it to Github then. My bad.

Along with a friend of mine, [Mahikanth Nag](http://github.com/mahikanthnag), I am starting over this project again with new features with the name **Cross Talk**. I will write about as soon as I find time. That repo can be found at https://github.com/dailywageworkers/crosstalk-chrome.
