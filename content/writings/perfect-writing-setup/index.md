> You donâ€™t need this to start writing. This is just icing over the cake and a process that fits nicely in my routine.

The setup involves 2 apps, Working Copy & iA Writer, and my iPad. And it costs 1799 + 2699 INR.

**Working Copy** is a Git client for iOS and iPadOS. I works really well to clone, add new commits and push (requires a pro subscription, hence 1799 cost).

**iA Writer** is a beautiful, focused, markdown writing app. Its the one you see in the picture above.

## How it works together

Working copy clones the repositories to the Files locally. I open the repo in iA Writer and edit / add new content. I go back to Working Copy, select the changes and push. The website is updated. ðŸŽ‰

## Things I like in this setup

- **Offline first**. I can open and start writing on iPad irrespective of the network connection
- Syncs directly to GitHub, so it gets built and deployed when updated.
- It looks beautiful, keeps me focused and lets me use my iPad. Which is good because, I donâ€™t want to open / sit with my laptop after work.

This is likely to evolve or discarded completely. ðŸ˜…\
Iâ€™ll post the updates here as usual.
